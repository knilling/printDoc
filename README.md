# printDoc

The .js is a stupid simple script to automate printing an Office Document (docx, msg, etc).  It expects the full path to the file as a command line argument.

The .bat wraps the .js in a for loop and prints everything in the current dir.

Manually set your default printer to "Adobe PDF" or "Microsoft Print to PDF" to batch print to PDF.
